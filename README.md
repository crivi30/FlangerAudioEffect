# Flanging

Flanging is an audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals together, one signal delayed by a small and gradually changing period,
usually smaller than 20 milliseconds. This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced in the resulting frequency 
spectrum, related to each other in a linear harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and down the frequency 
spectrum. A flanger is an effects unit that creates this effect.

Part of the output signal is usually fed back to the input (a "re-circulating delay line"), producing a resonance effect which further 
enhances the intensity of the peaks and troughs. The phase of the fed-back signal is sometimes inverted, producing another variation 
on the flanger sound.
